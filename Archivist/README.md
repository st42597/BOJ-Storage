### 입력 

 The only line of input contains a single integer $y$ ($1995 \le y \le 2019$), denoting the year. You don't need to process year numbers less than $1995$ or greater than $2019$, or incorrect year formats. It is guaranteed that you will be given a number between $1995$ and $2019$, inclusive.
### 출력 

 Print the winner of the contest in year $y$ exactly in the same format as in the list above.
